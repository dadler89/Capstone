# NHL STARING GOALIE PROJECT

## Overview

Have you ever played Daily Fantasy Hockey and not know who the starting goalie was for the team you selected? Or have you ever crated your line-up only to find out that the goalie you selected was not playing that night? If you have been frustrated by these questions my website will help you! We will be confirming the starting goalie for each team.

I wanted to create a website that focuses on this problem for many DFS players like myself. This tool will not only help me, but it will help anyone who plays DFS. Through this website I will be able to help protect your money by never picking the wrong goaltender! 

Also, another perk of this website will be a line-up tweet portion. This will be coming from verified and reliable sources of what each team practice lines are. That will help you determine if you need to make a change in your roster in case of player injury! Or if a player is moved up or down in the line-up to help maximize your roster potential.
